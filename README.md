# SmartMediaCenter

A mobile client-server architecture for controlling your home cinema

## Hardware setup
You have an environment with the following hardware equipment:
* Ideally, a low-energy single-board computer like a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). Or otherwise: Just a computer that can act as a server. Let's call it the **Service Host**. It is permanently on-line and accessible from the internet through proper NAT-settings on your home network's router. Make sure your router itself is accessible through a static IP address. Alternatively, you can set it up to use a Dynamic DNS server. Find some free ones [here](https://www.noip.com/free), [here](https://www.dnsdynamic.org/) or [here](http://www.dyndnss.net/updater.php). The Service Host needs to be able to wake up the following host:
* Any personal Desktop computer, called the **Player Host** that can be woken up in some form by the Service Host. Typically, that's via Wake-on-LAN or some similar technology. So to make things easy, the Player Host must be connected with the Sevice Host via an *Ethernet LAN wire*. The Player Host must also have internet access and be able to play back audio and video multimedia content on its hardware. For reasons still to uncover, it should also have a *Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device* (USB-dongle or internal) permanently activated. It is extended by the following output periphery *permanently connected* to it:
* Speakers
* Headphones (optional)
* A projector (very important!). What would a proper home cinema be without a projector? Right. Just any projector that serves your standards will do. As long as it can be connected to the Player Host's graphics card to display its output, whether via VGA, DMI, HDMI, DP or whatever. But *most importantly*: It must be possible for the projector to be switched on and off by the Player Host! It might be hard to imagine how. This could be possible, if the projector, too, has an Ethernet LAN port and supports Wake-on-LAN, as it is expected by the Player Host. But this already forces the Player Host to have at least two Ethernet LAN ports (remember, one already taken for connecting to the Service Host). Also, Ethernet-enabled projectors are not that common, not to talk of them supporting Wake-on-LAN. Anyway, modern marvels have made it possible to gap bridges like these. Which brings us to the final equipment:
* A Naran [MicroBot Push](https://prota.info/). This miracle worker serves as a robotic finger that can push buttons anywhere you place it. It can be controlled via Bluetooth Low Energy device. That's why the Player Host should have a BLE device, while the MicroBot Push gets placed right on top of your projectors on-button. The Player Host will switch the projector on or off all by itself, when needed!
* A mobile device with any OS of your choice. Just needs to have mobile internet and a modern web-browser installed. Of course, it's your router's DNS address you're going to type into the browser. And *very important*: The mobile device must have its *GPS activated permanently*.

## Software components

### SmartMediaCenter Player
The player component of SmartMediaCenter. Accessed through RMI by the SMC Service. Hosted on its own host that is woken up or set asleep by the SMC Service host, as required.

### SmartMediaCenter Service
The service component of SmartMediaCenter, providing a GWT-RPC-based access service for mobile web clients to the SMC through Servlets on a Tomcat webserver serving compiled JavaScript web pages as a GUI. The component is meant to be hosted on a permanently accessible host with very low energy consumption, like as Raspberry Pi. Besides providing the mentioned service to a mobile web-client, this component controls the current playback configuration and the state of media playback on the SMC Player component host via RMI. For this purpose, it also wakes up or sets asleep the SMC Player host, as required.

## The typical use case

Imagine you're in the office, on your way home, shopping downtown, or wherever you are at the moment, except: Home. But you've got a webapp on your mobile device, that allows you select what you want to be watching in your home cinema, once you get home. You just select one of those so-called *Virtual Channels* from a list in that app, and continue what you're doing. But once you enter your home later that day, you'll be hearing some music coming from your living room. And entering your living room, you'll find that some internet video stream is playing on your projector, which is connected to your PC. The video shows some panoramic views of the Swiss Alps. But its sound is on mute, while some audio player plays Haydn's Emperor Quartett from your hard disk. You're hearing that through your Sourround Sound Speakers, also connected to your PC.

## Key concept: *Virtual Channels*
The playback of content by the SmartMediaCenter Player is organized around the concept of *Virtual Broadcasts* and *Virtual Channels*, with *Audio Resource Configs* and *Video Resource Configs* at their base. Think of the following situation:

You know a lot of beautiful video streams that offer great visual content, such as [panoramic landscape recordings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkRRgjvVUp40wNlE-9DEWbw/videos) or downtown tours of amazing cities, [old](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmkULBzDRR-VXwX3ffiYd3w/videos) and [modern](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A/videos) on Youtube, or even a broadcast on your [local public television channel webstream](https://www.zdf.de/live-tv) that may show a live football match. But typically, you completely dislike the corny background music in it, or the lack of any at all, or the boring German football commentary. You want to replace the audio part with something [classier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t3Vmo_EM8Y) for those landscapes or old cities, some [exciting talk radio show](https://www.youtube.com/user/ybrook/videos) for those skyscraper views, or just some [fan music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APdC_YhkSd4) for the football match. Or, if the classy music for the medieval city isn't enough, maybe you might want to add in some great audio lecture about its history as well. But in an appropriate volume, so it's not completely swallowed by the music.

In any case, you want to replace the useless audio in the video with something much more appropriate to the visual content, in your view, and pretend like it's really part of the video. One way to do this is, of course, manually: Mute the audio in the video resource and dig out and open what you want to hear in separate audio player instances running in parallel. Even more time consuming, you could use some video studio software to create new video files that include the audio you want in it. But all of that can become very irritating at some point, having to recollect, fine-tune and start what goes together every time for hundreds of such audio-video playback combinations. Switching the combination spontaneously several times a day? Even more irritating. And you will not be doing that as frequently and spontaneously as you would like to.

The alternative is, to have a software manage all that. One that allows you to simply select and play a ready-made setup like this, we'll call it a **Virtual Channel**, from a list. So the heart of the configuration for the SmartMediaCenter Service, is simply in editing the lists of Media Resources (audio and video) and their combinations, playback volumes and playback devices (speaker or headphone, screen or projector) in such Virtual Channel configurations.

## Developer hints
* Everything completely Maven-ized, even the installation. No need to set up as an OS service.
* Fully preconfigured Tomcat, including user access control and certificate. Just run the Maven-based setup.jar per component
